# Word-Frequency-in-Moby-Dick

In this project, you'll scrape a novel from an html file taken from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python requests package. Then you'll extract text from this web data using the BeautifulSoup library. Finally, you'll analyze the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk), a very common NLP task used to gain insights on textual data and lay the groundwork for deeper analysis.

The natural language processing tools used here are required for many important data science tasks as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured and includes a great deal of text. To complete this project, you need to know how to import web data into Python and how to work with natural language text.
